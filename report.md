# lab 01 reflection

in this lab, I set up git and git hub , learned how to create files inside folder. I created an index.html file and practiced basic git operations such as add,commit,push,branching, and merging. i merged a branch "experiment"with "main".Creating and deleting files helped me understand how git tracks changes.This exercise boosted my confidence in using version control for future projects.
